# Speech-Recognition-CTC-decoder
MNIST Speech Recognition using encoder:
  1) RNN (Recurrent neural network)
  2) Transformer Encoder

and CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) as decoder.

**Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is used for feature extraction.**

**Disclaimer**- *Custom learning rate for Transformer Encoder is needed to be suitably tuned*
